# Conditions

In computer science, conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use **if** to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use **else** to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use **else if** to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
