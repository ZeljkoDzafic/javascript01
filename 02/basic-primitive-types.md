# Promitive types

A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types: **string**, **number**, **boolean**, **ull**, **undefined**, symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).

In javascript Integers, Floats are considered as numbers.

For a variable, declaration means just stating its data type along with giving it name for memory allocation; while definition means giving the value of that variable. declaration is giving a prototype like simply a name . definition is associating the task or the meaning with the prototype.

If variable is not defined we get data type - undefined;
